# Marvel App

A basic data-driven list app that makes use of Marvel Comics' REST API.

## Configuration

You'll need a Marvel developer account. You can get one for free at [http://developer.marvel.com/](http://developer.marvel.com/). Once you have your account, open app.hjs and replace `YOUR_MARVEL_PUBLIC_KEY` and `YOUR_MARVEL_PRIVATE_KEY` with your Marvel API public and private keys, respectively.
